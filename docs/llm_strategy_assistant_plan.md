# LLM AI Assistant for Strategy Creation: Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a plan to enhance the strategy creation process by implementing an LLM AI assistant button. This feature will allow business users to describe their requirements in natural language, and the AI will generate appropriate instructions and JSON schema for extraction strategies based on backend rules. The goal is to simplify the strategy creation process for non-technical users while maintaining the robustness of the extraction framework.

## Current State Assessment

Based on the project structure and recent fixes to extraction strategies, we understand that:

1. The system uses various LLM extraction strategies (News, Social Media, NFT, etc.)
2. Each strategy requires specific `SCHEMA` and `INSTRUCTION` class attributes
3. Creating these strategies currently requires technical knowledge of JSON schema structure and LLM prompting
4. Business users likely struggle with the technical aspects of strategy creation

## Proposed Solution: LLM AI Assistant

### Concept Overview

Implement an AI assistant button in the strategy creation UI that will:

1. Allow users to describe their data extraction needs in natural language
2. Generate appropriate `INSTRUCTION` and `SCHEMA` based on backend rules and requirements
3. Populate the strategy creation form with generated content
4. Allow users to review, tweak, and save the generated strategy

### Feasibility Assessment

#### Technical Feasibility

- **High**: The project already integrates with LLM providers (OpenRouter, etc.)
- **Existing Components**: The strategy UI, database integration, and LLM connection are already in place
- **Required Extensions**: Need to add a new UI component and backend processing for the assistant feature

#### Complexity Assessment

- **Medium**: Requires integration of existing components rather than building from scratch
- **Key Challenges**: Ensuring generated strategies follow the correct format and validation rules

#### Business Value

- **High**: Significantly lowers the barrier to entry for business users
- **Improves Adoption**: Makes the platform more accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- **Reduces Errors**: Minimizes syntax and structural errors in manually created strategies

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Backend LLM Integration

1. **Create Assistant Strategy Generator Class**
   - Develop a new class that handles LLM interaction for strategy generation
   - Implement methods to convert user requirements to LLM prompts
   - Create validation to ensure generated strategies meet system requirements

2. **Define Prompt Engineering**
   - Create templates that instruct the LLM on strategy format requirements
   - Include examples of valid strategies as few-shot learning examples
   - Implement guardrails to prevent hallucination or invalid outputs

3. **Implement Strategy Validation**
   - Ensure generated strategies have valid JSON schema
   - Verify that all required fields are present
   - Check that instructions are appropriate for the strategy type

### Phase 2: Frontend Integration

1. **UI Component Development**
   - Add an "AI Assistant" button to the strategy creation form
   - Create a modal dialog for users to input their requirements
   - Implement a loading state during LLM processing

2. **Form Population Logic**
   - Develop logic to populate form fields with generated strategy content
   - Allow users to edit generated content before saving
   - Provide visual indicators for AI-generated content

3. **User Experience Enhancements**
   - Add tooltips and guidance for using the AI assistant
   - Implement error handling for failed generation attempts
   - Create a feedback mechanism for improving the assistant

### Phase 3: Testing and Refinement

1. **Functional Testing**
   - Test with various user requirement inputs
   - Verify generated strategies work correctly when executed
   - Ensure UI components function as expected

2. **User Acceptance Testing**
   - Conduct sessions with business users
   - Gather feedback on usability and effectiveness
   - Identify areas for improvement

3. **Refinement**
   - Tune LLM prompts based on testing results
   - Improve UI based on user feedback
   - Optimize performance and reliability

## Technical Architecture

### Components

1. **StrategyAssistantGenerator**
   - Core class handling LLM interaction and strategy generation
   - Interfaces with existing extraction strategy framework

2. **AssistantPromptManager**
   - Manages prompt templates and examples
   - Handles conversion of user requirements to LLM prompts

3. **StrategyValidator**
   - Validates generated strategies against system requirements
   - Provides feedback for invalid strategies

4. **UI Components**
   - Assistant button and modal dialog
   - Form population handlers
   - Feedback mechanisms

### Data Flow

1. User clicks "AI Assistant" button in strategy creation UI
2. User enters requirements in natural language
3. Frontend sends requirements to backend API
4. Backend converts requirements to LLM prompt
5. LLM generates strategy content
6. Backend validates generated content
7. Valid strategy is returned to frontend
8. Frontend populates form fields with generated content
9. User reviews, edits if needed, and saves strategy

## Potential Challenges and Mitigations

### Challenge 1: LLM Output Quality

**Risk**: Generated strategies may not meet quality standards or contain errors.

**Mitigation**:
- Implement robust validation
- Use few-shot learning with high-quality examples
- Provide clear error messages for invalid generations

### Challenge 2: User Expectation Management

**Risk**: Users may expect perfect results from the AI assistant.

**Mitigation**:
- Clearly communicate that generated strategies are starting points
- Provide easy editing capabilities
- Include guidance on how to improve generated strategies

### Challenge 3: Performance Considerations

**Risk**: LLM generation may be slow, affecting user experience.

**Mitigation**:
- Implement asynchronous processing
- Add clear loading indicators
- Consider caching common patterns

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 1 (Backend Integration)**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 2 (Frontend Integration)**: 1-2 weeks
- **Phase 3 (Testing and Refinement)**: 1-2 weeks

**Total Estimated Time**: 4-7 weeks

## Conclusion

Implementing an LLM AI assistant for strategy creation will significantly improve the usability of the platform for business users. By leveraging existing LLM integration and the current strategy framework, this feature can be developed efficiently and provide immediate value to users. The phased approach allows for iterative improvement and ensures that the final product meets user needs effectively.

## Next Steps

1. Finalize requirements and scope
2. Develop detailed technical specifications
