# Generic LLM-Based Crawler Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive implementation plan for a generic LLM-based crawler with URL-extractor association, designed with award-winning web design principles, professional architecture, and exceptional usability.

## Architecture Principles
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between crawling, extraction, and UI layers
- **Modularity**: Pluggable extractors and configurable crawling strategies
- **Scalability**: Async-first design with proper resource management
- **Extensibility**: Easy addition of new extractors and providers
- **User Experience**: Intuitive UI with real-time feedback and beautiful aesthetics

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Foundation)

### 1.1 Generic AsyncWebCrawler Implementation
- Replace mock `CryptoCrawler` with production-ready `GenericAsyncCrawler`
- Integrate Crawl4AI's `AsyncWebCrawler` with proper configuration
- Support multiple extraction strategies per URL
- Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms
- Add comprehensive logging and monitoring

### 1.2 Enhanced URL-Extractor Mapping System
- Upgrade existing URL mapping to support one-to-many relationships
- Implement database persistence with SQLite/PostgreSQL support
- Add pattern matching with priority-based selection
- Create RESTful API for programmatic access

### 1.3 Modern UI Framework
- Migrate from Tkinter to modern web-based UI (React/Vue.js)
- Implement responsive design with mobile support
- Add real-time status updates via WebSockets
- Create beautiful, intuitive interface with dark/light themes

### 1.4 Database Integration
- Set up proper database schema for mappings and results
- Implement connection pooling and transaction management
- Add data validation and integrity constraints
- Create migration system for schema updates

## Phase 2: Enhanced Extraction & UI

### 2.1 Advanced Extraction Pipeline
- Implement parallel extraction with multiple strategies
- Add result aggregation and conflict resolution
- Create extraction result caching system
- Implement content preprocessing and optimization

### 2.2 Professional UI Components
- Design system with consistent typography and spacing
- Interactive URL pattern builder with live preview
- Drag-and-drop extractor assignment interface
- Real-time extraction preview and testing
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities

### 2.3 Performance Optimization
- Implement intelligent caching strategies
- Add request rate limiting and throttling
- Optimize database queries with proper indexing
- Create performance monitoring dashboard

### 2.4 Configuration Management
- Environment-based configuration system
- Import/export functionality for mappings
- Backup and restore capabilities
- Version control for configuration changes

## Phase 3: Production Features & Monitoring

### 3.1 Advanced Features
- Scheduled crawling with cron-like expressions
- Webhook notifications for extraction events
- Bulk URL import from CSV/JSON files
- API rate limiting and authentication

### 3.2 Monitoring & Analytics
- Prometheus metrics integration
- Grafana dashboards for visualization
- Real-time performance monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting system

### 3.3 Security & Compliance
- API key management and rotation
- Input sanitization and validation
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Audit logging for compliance

### 3.4 Documentation & Testing
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Interactive testing interface
- Unit and integration test coverage
- Performance benchmarking suite

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Framework**: FastAPI (async, high-performance)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Caching**: Redis for session and result caching
- **Queue**: Celery for background tasks
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **UI Library**: Material-UI or Ant Design
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO for live updates
- **Styling**: Styled-components with theme support

### Infrastructure
