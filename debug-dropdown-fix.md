# URL Mapping Dropdown State Sharing Fix

## Issue Description
URL mapping dropdowns in the crawler creation modal were sharing state across different instances. When a user selected a URL mapping in one crawler modal, it would affect the selection in other crawler modals. Additionally, after selecting and saving a URL mapping, the selection would disappear immediately without page refresh.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: State Sharing Between Modal Instances
The problem was in `CrawlerFormWithURLMapping.tsx` where the component was maintaining state across multiple modal instances. The component wasn't properly resetting its state when the modal closed.

### Issue 2: Selection Disappearing After Save
The initial fix was too aggressive - it was resetting state whenever `isOpen` changed, including during form submission when the modal might briefly close and reopen.

## Solution

### Fix 1: Proper Modal State Management
Implemented a more sophisticated state reset mechanism that tracks modal open/close transitions:

```typescript
const [wasOpen, setWasOpen] = useState(false);

useEffect(() => {
  if (isOpen && !wasOpen) {
    // Modal is opening - don't reset if we have initial data
    setWasOpen(true);
  } else if (!isOpen && wasOpen) {
    // Modal is closing - reset all state
    setWasOpen(false);
    setSelectedMappingId('');
    setInheritedBlueprint(null);
    setShowInheritedSettings(false);
    setIsAutoConfigured(false);
    setValidationErrors({});
    
    // Reset form data to defaults only if not editing
    if (!isEdit) {
      setFormData(/* default values */);
    }
  }
}, [isOpen, wasOpen, isEdit]);
```

### Key Improvements:
1. **Transition Tracking**: Only resets when transitioning from open to closed
2. **Edit Mode Protection**: Preserves state when editing existing crawlers
3. **Save Operation Safety**: Doesn't interfere with form submission process

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/components/CrawlerFormWithURLMapping.tsx`

## Testing
1. ✅ Open multiple crawler creation modals - selections remain independent
2. ✅ Select URL mapping and save - selection persists through save operation
3. ✅ Close and reopen modals - clean state for new instances
4. ✅ Edit existing crawlers - preserves current URL mapping selection

## Status
✅ **RESOLVED** - Both state sharing and disappearing selection issues fixed
