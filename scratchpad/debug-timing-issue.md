# Dropdown Selection Timing Issue - RESOLVED

## Root Cause Identified
From console logs when clicking Edit:
- `URLMappingDropdown - selectedMappingId: 1`
- `URLMappingDropdown - Found selected option: undefined`

This confirms the timing issue: `selectedMappingId` is set before `dropdownOptions` are populated.

## Solution Applied
1. **Consolidated useEffect hooks** in CrawlerFormWithURLMapping.tsx to ensure proper sequencing
2. **Added dependency on urlMappings** to the initialization effect
3. **Added console logging** to track the selection process
4. **Enhanced URLMappingDropdown** with better debugging logs

## Technical Details
- The dropdown receives `selectedMappingId` but `dropdownOptions` array is still empty
- `selectedOption` becomes undefined because `find()` operation fails on empty array
- Fixed by ensuring URL mappings are loaded before setting selection

## Status: RESOLVED
The timing issue has been identified and fixed through proper effect dependency management.
