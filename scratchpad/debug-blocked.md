# Debug Session Blocked - URL Mapping Dropdown Issue

## Most likely cause: 85% confidence
Timing mismatch in URLMappingDropdown.tsx where `selectedMappingId` is set before `dropdownOptions` are populated, causing `selectedOption` to be undefined when dropdown renders.

## Applied fixes:
1. Consolidated useEffect hooks in CrawlerFormWithURLMapping.tsx
2. Added urlMappings dependency to initialization effect  
3. Enhanced debugging logs in both components
4. Added selectedMappingId to URLMappingDropdown useEffect dependencies

## Blocking issue:
Browser automation failing with technical errors preventing live testing of the fix. User reports issue persists despite fixes.

## Next step if this fails:
Manual testing required - user should:
1. Open browser to http://localhost:3000
2. Navigate to crawler edit form
3. Check browser console for debug logs showing:
   - "URLMappingDropdown - Generating options"
   - "URLMappingDropdown - Looking for selectedMappingId"
   - "URLMappingDropdown - Found selected option" vs "undefined"

## Root cause analysis:
The issue occurs because React's useEffect dependency arrays weren't properly synchronized between form initialization and dropdown option generation. Despite fixes, user reports persistence - may need deeper investigation into component lifecycle.
